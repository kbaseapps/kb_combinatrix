See the main README for how to set up your environment to run tests.

The folder [`data/raw`](data/raw/) contains a very small dataset (two sample sets and an amplicon matrix) for development and testing purposes.

The [`data/cassettes`](data/cassettes/) comprises the recorded API responses to the queries run by the tests. To force new responses to be recorded, delete the folder contents and ensure that you provide an authentication token for the appropriate server.
