        long-hint: |
        A list of pairs of data sets to combine to create the megatable.

        If you want to combine more than two tables, you will need to enter each pair of tables separately. For example, if you want to combine dataset A with dataset B by matching A's 'sample ID' with B's 'parent sample ID', and then combine dataset B with dataset C by matching B's 'temperature' with C's 'ambient_temp', you would add two parameter sets:

        dataset: A, field: 'sample ID', dataset: B, field: 'parent_sample_ID'

        dataset: B, field: 'temperature', dataset: C, field: 'ambient_temp'

        If one of the datasets is a matrix, the field name should be either 'column ID' or 'row ID'.

parameters :
    t1_ref:
        ui-name: join this dataset
        short-hint: A data set to combine with the base data set.
        long-hint: A data set to combine with the base data set.

    t1_field:
        ui-name: field name within the dataset
        short-hint: Join data sets on...
        long-hint: Join this data set to the other dataset using this field. If the dataset is a matrix, the match field should be set to 'column ID' or 'row ID', whichever is appropriate.

    t2_ref:
        ui-name: to this dataset
        short-hint: A data set to combine with the base data set.
        long-hint: A data set to combine with the base data set.

    t2_field:
        ui-name: field name within the dataset to join on
        short-hint: Join data sets on...
        long-hint: Join this data set to the other dataset using this field. If the dataset is a matrix, the match field should be set to 'column ID' or 'row ID', whichever is appropriate.

    <p>This app can be used to generate and view the combinations possible by combining datasets by matching a field in one dataset to a (potentially different) field in another dataset.</p>
